# Fullstack Authentication Example with Next.js and NextAuth.js

## Backend

The Backend implementation handles HTTP requests to create, read, update, and delete insurance applications. It uses Next.js and Prisma ORM to interact with a Supabase Postgresql database.

The API exports a single async function named handler that takes two arguments, a request object, and a response object. The request object contains information about the incoming HTTP request, while the response object is used to send back an HTTP response.

The function first destructures the properties of the request object, including the HTTP method, the request body, and query parameters. It also retrieves the ID from the request parameters.

The function then switches on the HTTP method to handle different types of requests. For instance, if the method is POST, the function creates a new insurance application in the database. It extracts the address, vehicles, and people objects from the request body, creates a new address, then creates a new insurance application that includes the address and the vehicles and people related to the application.

If the HTTP method is GET, the function retrieves an insurance application with the specified ID from the database and sends it back as the response. If the method is PUT, the function updates an existing insurance application with the specified ID using the data in the request body. If the method is DELETE, the function deletes the insurance application with the specified ID.

The interfaces.ts file contains interfaces for the different types of objects that can be sent and received by the API, including Address, Person, Vehicle, and InsuranceApplication. The interfaces define the properties of these objects, such as id, firstName, lastName, and dateOfBirth for a Person.
